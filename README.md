# BYLT NetSuite–Avectous Reconciliation Site

Three pages, one password gate:
- login.html      -> Sign in (password gate for the whole site)
- index.html      -> Dashboard (full detail: missing records + discrepancies) — landing page / first tab
- load-data.html  -> Load Data (upload NetSuite + Avectous CSVs or XLSX, compare)
- totals.html     -> Totals (just the summary numbers, one row per area)
- dashboard.html  -> redirects to index.html, in case anyone bookmarked the old link

## How data works

Data you load and compare on the Load Data page is saved two places:
1. **Your browser** (localStorage) — always works, no setup required.
2. **Netlify Blobs** (shared storage) — this is what makes it "live" for
   everyone who logs in, on any device, without them loading anything.

Dashboard and Totals check the shared store first, falling back to your
own browser's copy if the shared one has nothing for that area yet.

No external service, no tokens, no extra signup — Netlify Blobs comes
built into every Netlify site. An earlier attempt at this hit a persistent
502 error; that turned out to be a project configuration issue (dependency
version + bundler settings), not a fundamental Blobs problem — fixed by:
- Pinning `@netlify/blobs` to `^8.1.0` in `package.json` at the site root
  (not inside `netlify/functions/`)
- Explicitly setting `node_bundler = "esbuild"` in `netlify.toml`
- Using `getStore({ name, consistency: "strong" })` instead of the
  shorthand `getStore("name")`

If you ever bump the `@netlify/blobs` version, retest the shared sync
before relying on it — that version jump is what broke this originally.

## How the password gate works

- `netlify/functions/login.mjs` checks the password you type against an
  environment variable called `SITE_PASSWORD`. If it matches, it sets a
  signed, HttpOnly cookie.
- Every page runs `auth-check.js` on load, which asks the server "is this
  visitor's cookie valid?" — if not, it redirects to `login.html`.
- The cookie lasts 7 days, then you'll need to sign in again. "Log out" in
  the nav clears it immediately.

This is one shared password for anyone you give the link to — not
individual logins per person.

## Deploy to Netlify

**Recommended — Netlify CLI:**
1. Install once: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. From this folder: `netlify deploy --prod`
3. Set the environment variables (above), then redeploy

**Also works — drag and drop:**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag this whole folder onto the page
3. Add environment variables in Site settings, then trigger a redeploy

**Also works — GitHub-connected:**
1. Push this folder's contents to a GitHub repo
2. Netlify → Add new project → Import an existing project → pick the repo
3. Build command: blank. Publish directory: repo root.
4. Add environment variables, deploy.

## Notes

- No database, no third-party storage service, no tokens required — just
  the two password-related environment variables above.
- If `auth-check.js` can't reach `/api/check-auth` (e.g. you open a page by
  double-clicking it on your computer instead of via the live Netlify URL),
  it logs a warning to the console instead of blocking you — the password
  gate only actually works once this is deployed.
